Hi Everyone

I decided I'd be creative and make a fun project ... so you get a Steampunk Calculator.


It's built using Visual Studio Community 2015. Primarily it shows of some of my abilities with MFC and it shows some of my C++ abilities. It's a dialog based app.


It's all about UI! It's always challenging  to make MFC apps look flashy and modern so I thought would be a fun to do. While I admit this kind of project doesn't show off my ability to write a super awesome easy to use C++ template class that wraps up an incredible complex ATL COM base class that I use in several similar other COM objects ... it was still challenging.  


I battled with simple things like drawing pictures on controls with transparency. I ended up using GDI+ for that. Even started writing a nifty class to wrap some of that up ... until I discovered the same class on MSDN. Always Google first!


Anyhow let me know if you have any issues.


Cheers,

Pat


PS ... no unit test. For the life of my I can't make Visual Studios native Unit Test framework test MFC UI classes. If you really need some unit tests I will figure something out.
